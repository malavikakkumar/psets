Note from last class:
Match-case statements are for a fixed number of cases, 
instead of evaluations of conditions!    

LOOPS:
A FOR loop is a loop that runs for a preset number of times.
A WHILE loop is a loop that is repeated as long as an expression is true.Â 

"""

# for loop

for i in range(1,5): # iterates through range 1-4 (1, 2, 3, 4)
    print(i) # prints each value of i for each iteration
    
for i in range(1,10): # iterates through range 1-10 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
    # executes below statement for the number of iterations       
    print("AAAAAAAAAA I AM IN THE LOOP AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA")

print()    
print("I AM OUT OF THE LOOP WHEW")

myDrinks = ['vodka', 'gin', 'lager', 'cider']
for x in myDrinks: # iterates through each element of the list
    print (x)

# another way to iterate through lists
for y in range(len(myDrinks)):
    print(myDrinks[y])

# while loop

i = 1
while i < 6: # while given condition is true
    print(i)
    i += 1 # increments variable on left by 1

i = 0
while i <= 10: # while given condition is true
    print("AAAAAAAAAA I AM IN THE LOOP AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA")
    i += 1 # increments i
print()    
print("I AM OUT OF THE LOOP WHEW")

"""
EXITING/CONTROLLING LOOPS IN OTHER WAYS:
    
A 'break' command exits out a loop entirely.

A 'continue' command skips the remaining commands in the loop
and moves on to the next iteration.
"""

i = 0
while i < 6:
    i += 1
    if i == 3:
        continue # skips to the next iteration of the loop
    print (i)
    
"""
VARIABLE SCOPE:
The region of the code in which a variable or resource
is visible and accessible.

Local scope: Within a certain function, the variables declared
would only exist inside that function and nothing outside it.

Global scope: Accessible throughout the program
Usually declared at the top of the script

"""

for i in range(0,5):
    x = i
    print(x)
    
print(x)


for y in myDrinks:
    if y == 'vodka':
        flag = 1
    else:
        flag = 0
    print ("Vodka: ", flag)

print ("Vodka: ", flag) 
# so I guess this isn't just a variable existing in the loop lmao

"""
FUNCTIONS and CLASSES:
* Functions are modular bits of code which can take
arguments (inputs), carry out a particular task or operation,
and can return values (outputs)
* Classes are FUNCTIONS that have data (ATTRIBUTES)
and operations (METHODS) for handling said data.
A form of object oriented programming.
Various INSTANCES can then be created for a given class.
