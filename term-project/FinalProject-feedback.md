:memo: **check+**

#### Documentation:
* I appreciated the readme file but it could have been a bit more detailed maybe. Similarly I like that you documented the functions but I wonder if you could have written them like true help functions that describe the method of use
:memo: **check/check+**

#### Complexity, scale of tasks/analysis, and mastery:
* I really like that you were able to simulate some EEG data. Very cool!
 :memo: **check+**

#### Completeness:
* No  friction. Only critique is it would be easier to access as a stand-alone repository.
