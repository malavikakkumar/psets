Run the scripts in this order:

1. Randomization - this is to create the experimental stimuli lists from MasterList.csv (as uploaded in this folder)
2. Experiment - this is to run the actual experiment and collect behavioural data from the participant.
3. Simulation - this is to simulate EEG data for any of the experimental stimuli lists that have been generated in the first step.
